# Driving

Steering wheel is now complete!

You can use your hands as steering wheel in racing games and drive just by pretending real wheel exists in front of you.
You will need:
- mediapipe
- opencv
- vgamepad (that includes nefarius virtual gamepad emulation bus)
- webcam
- at least 3GHz CPU (hand tracking is expensive operation, anything lower and it will not track properly)
- Windows (vgamepad only works on windows)
